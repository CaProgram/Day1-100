# Replit's 100 Days of Python Challenge

This repository contains my progress for Replit's 100 Days of Python Challenge. I'll be coding along with the daily exercises to improve my Python skills and build some fun projects over the next 100 days.

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to:

- Learn Python by coding for at least 10 minutes every day for 100 consecutive days.
- Build a strong habit of coding and problem-solving.
- Explore Python's vast capabilities and apply them in different projects.
- Track progress and document the journey along the way.

I will be using Replit, a fantastic online IDE, to make sure I can code from anywhereâ€”whether itâ€™s at home, in a coffee shop, or even in the middle of a field! No excuses for missing a day of coding! ðŸš€

## How to Follow My Progress

You can track my progress on Replit at [replit.com/christianaswell](https://replit.com/christianaswell). Each day, Iâ€™ll be adding new code, solving problems, and sharing my learning experiences.

## Challenges and Projects

As I go through the challenge, Iâ€™ll be building mini-projects and solving coding problems. Hereâ€™s what you can expect:

- Basic Python syntax and concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures and algorithms
- Web scraping, APIs, and more!

Iâ€™ll be updating this repository regularly with my daily code snippets, explanations, and project files. 

Feel free to join me, contribute, or even create your own challenge with me!

## Motivation

Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into Python and expand my skills, and I hope this challenge keeps me motivated to keep learning every single day. ðŸ¥³

Let's get coding!
